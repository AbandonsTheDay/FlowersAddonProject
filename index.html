            Wildflowers are flowers that are found in places such as forests or
            fields, rather than in a yard or garden. Typically, they are native
            to wherever they are bloomming. Native plants are important to our
            ecosystem. They play roles that support our everyday lives, such as
            providing us with food or helping to cycle toxic elements from our
            environment.
