          like an exotic dream The radio playing songs that I have never heard I
          don't know what to say, oh not another word Just la la la la la it
          goes around the world Just la la la la la it's all around the world
          Just la la la la la and everybody's singing La la la la la and now the
          bells are ringing La la la la la, la la la la la la la, la la la la
          la, la la la la la la la La la la la la, la la la la la la la, la la
